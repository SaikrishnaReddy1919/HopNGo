## 🧑‍💻 Task 1 — React Native Developer  
### **Title:** Build a “Ride List & Ride Details” Flow

**Goal:**  
Create a simple interface to display a list of available rides and view ride details.

### **Requirements**
1. Use **React Native** (Expo or React Native CLI).
2. Implement two screens using **React Navigation**:
   - **Rides List Screen:**  
     - Show a list of rides (hardcoded data).  
     - Each ride should display:  
       - Driver name  
       - From → To locations  
       - Time and price  
   - **Ride Details Screen:**  
     - Display full ride details when a ride is selected.  
     - Include a “Book Ride” button (no functionality needed).
3. Use **FlatList** for the ride list.
4. Follow clean UI and folder structure (`components/`, `screens/`, etc.).
5. Write a short **README** explaining:  
   - How to run the project  
   - What libraries were used  
   - A short summary of what you learned

**Bonus (Optional):**
- Add a simple search bar (not functional, just UI).
- Use dummy profile pictures for drivers.

**Deliverable:**  
A public GitHub repository with the React Native project.
